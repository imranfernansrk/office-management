Traditional web hosting services were simply too complicated, time consuming, and expensive to manage. We created the Website.com Site Builder with the users perspective in mind. We wanted to offer a platform that would require no coding skills or design experience. We keep it simple, so users can focus on creating an amazing website that reflects their brand. Best of all - it is free. You can get online, showcase your brand, or start selling products right away.",
